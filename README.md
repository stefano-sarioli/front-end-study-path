# Front end study path
#### A personal study path for front end development.

## Descriptions

I'm a back end developer. In the past, I worked as a front end developer. The front end development it's a field that moves fast, and now I feel like I'm too far behind, I don't like that.

This personal study path is the first step to become a great front end developer.

Why? Because it's a new challenge to improve myself.

My study path is based on this great [post](https://medium.com/@kamranahmedse/modern-frontend-developer-in-2018-4c2072fa2b9c).
